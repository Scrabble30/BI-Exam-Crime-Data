We compared BI use cases in public policy and correctional program evaluation to pinpoint how data-driven insights can optimize rehabilitation strategies.")

We examine how sentence severity and educational attainment affect the likelihood and timing of reoffense within three years. Using BI tools and predictive modeling, we aim to forecast recidivism risk for individuals based on these key variables. Insights will support policymakers and social workers in designing targeted interventions to reduce reoffending and improve reintegration outcomes.")
